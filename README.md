# NaturalLanguageProcessing1.1
Using Tensorflow exploring different libraries and methods options in Natural Language Processing




## Contents of notebook :
- Basics of Natural Language Processing
- Tokenizer_Basic
- pad_sequences



## Language and Libraries 
- Python 3 and above
- pandas => For Exploratory Data Analysis 
- numpy => to work with dimensions (arrays)
- matplotlib => to visualize the data, and look for pattern
- seaborn => to get over all analysis of data using graphs
- Tensoflow 2.0
- keras



## Software Required (Basic setup)
- IPython environment and Jupyter notebooks
- Python 3
- Conda for package management and virtual environments

If it is not able to install and run these software on the local system
then, online [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notbook can be used to do the same.

However, the jupyter notebooks in this repository are directly made in Google colab environment, and there is a direct link provided to the notebook (at the top of each noteboo).
